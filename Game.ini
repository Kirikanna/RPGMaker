Title=Shared HP Battle System - WIP
Description=Hello everyone, this is my first script that I'm working on, still learning the ropes but I think I have somewhat of a grasp with Ruby. Feel free to laugh at my terrible code and give me pointers on how to improve upon it.%n%%n%This system is functionally identical to the default battle system, but the difference is, everyone's HP is pooled together and when any member heals or takes damage, only the pool is affected.%n%Another thing to note is that this system adds to the default menu screen to show the party's current total HP.%n%%n%This is still a work-in-progress so please don't mind the messiness. I actually would love input on how to improve upon updating the GUI to reflect this system. %n%%n%Functionally, there shouldn't be any bugs, but please let me know if you run into any.%n%%n%[url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80680048/Battler_SharedHPBeta.7z]Dropbox Mirror[/url]%n%%n%Links to the three classes for this system (paste them in order above main):%n%[url=http://pastebin.com/QFtZAnEi]Shared_HP[/url]%n%[url=http://pastebin.com/KZ9D2he4]Shared_HP_ValueDisplay[/url]%n%[url=http://pastebin.com/V4w5023y]Shared_HP_MenuWindow[/url]%n%%n%YEA Battle Engine compatibility%n%[url=https://yanflychannel.wordpress.com/rmvxa/battle-scripts/ace-battle-engine/]Check it out, it's a great system.[/url]%n%Please read the instructions in the compatibility script.%n%[url=http://pastebin.com/MWifUn7M]Shared_HP add on for the engine[/url]%n%%n%Neo Gauge Ultimate Ace compatibility%n%[url=https://pacmanvx.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/neo-gauge-ultimate/]These gauges are shiny, check it out![/url]%n%Please read the instructions in the script.%n%[url=http://pastebin.com/qNSTGQDN]Shared_HP compatibility for Neo Gauge Ultimate Ace[/url]%n%%n%Yanfly's Command Party compatibility (new!)%n%[url=https://yanflychannel.wordpress.com/rmvxa/core-scripts/party-system/command-party/]Check it out, it's pretty nice.[/url]%n%Instructions are in script.%n%[url=http://pastebin.com/Qec2GX3Y]Yanfly's Command Party compatibility[/url]%n%%n%default battle system, but the difference is, %n%everyone's HP is pooled together, and when any%n%member heals/takes damage, only the pool is affected.%n%default battle system, but the difference is, %n%everyone's HP is pooled together, and when any%n%member heals/takes damage, only the pool is affected.
